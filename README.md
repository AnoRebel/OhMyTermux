# Oh My Zsh - Termux (OhMyTermux)

This is a simple script I altered from many sources(credits below) to my own liking to install [ohmyzsh](https://ohmyz.sh) in Termux for cool features and looks.

You can make your Termux look pretty much just like  your PC linux terminal, after installing this, add some of your dotfile configs and see the magic.


## Requirements

* Termux
* Love for your phone and linux


## Installation

1. Download Termux from Play-Store or F-Droid(and the termux-api too for better and more functionality)
2. Download the script or clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anorebel/OhMyTermux.git
```

3. Run the script


```bash
cd OhMyTermux

./install.sh
```
